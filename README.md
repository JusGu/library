# Library
Library is a great website for keeping track of all the books you've read!

It helps you keep track of your reading progress, including the title, author, a small description, and number of pages for each book. You can add new books and edit existing entries at any time, as well as filter your books by genre. 
    
Finally, Library allows you to hide finished books from your main view.
